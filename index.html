            <p>My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and read in class 7th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.</p>

Kinney initially struggled with the decision of whether Greg would be a non-aging "cartoon character" or a literary character that would age and go through puberty, deciding to make puberty one of the book's themes.[3] Kinney also debated over whether to end the series with five books, eventually deciding to continue the series.[4]

         A story tells that two friends were walking through the desert. During some point of the journey they had an argumentz and one friend slapped the other one in the face.The one who got slapped was hurt but without saying anything wrote in the sandtoday my best friend slapped me in the face.they kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but the friend saved him. After he recovered from the near drowning, he wrote on a stoneToday my best friend saved my life.The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him; I hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now you write on a ston why The other friend replied When someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it.Moral of the story: Don t value the things you have in your life. But value who you have in your life.
